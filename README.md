TurboDOS Operating System Release 1.43

TurboDOS licensing.
Mike Bush and Ron Raikes are the founders of Software 2000 Inc.

Quoted from Per Frejvall's post on comp.os.cpm:
TurboDOS is now free!
Bearer of good news, it is good to be!
Message from Mike Busch, co-founder of Software 2000 and creator of
TurboDOS:

"Per, Software 2000, Inc. Is no longer enforcing its copyright on
TurboDOS. Have fun with it, and thanks for asking. Mike"

Can you ask for more?
The bad part is that they don't have sources anymore.

We are now working to recover as much of TurboDOS as possible.
Please send a pull request or contact admin@turbodos.org if you have anything that can be added to this repository.
